## How It Works

1. Make sure your wallet is configured to use the Solana Devnet and that you have a Devnet SOL balance. You can get Devnet SOL [here](https://faucet.solana.com/).
2. Users play through the gamebook adventure by making choices which require transactions.
3. As they progress, new frames of Toly's adventure are generated.
4. Each frame is minted as a Metaplex Core NFT.
5. The NFT is sent to a newly created PDA associated with the user.
